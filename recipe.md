To help you start making kimchi at home, I came up with this recipe using one head of napa cabbage. Start with one, and then move to 2 or 3 by doubling or tripling the recipe.

It typically starts with salting the main vegetable. For this pogi kimchi, you need to cut the whole cabbage in half lengthwise, and then into quarters. If youâ€™re using 2 small cabbages, cutting in half should be enough.

Then, thoroughly bathe each cabbage half/quarter in the salt water one at a time. Using the other half cup of salt, generously sprinkle salt over the thick white part of each leaf. This process makes sure the white parts get evenly salted,

Meanwhile, make a kimchi paste by mixing all the seasoning ingredients, and then cut the radish into thin matchsticks and mix well with the paste. The rest is easy, rub a little bit of the radish mix over each cabbage leaf, mainly the white part.
